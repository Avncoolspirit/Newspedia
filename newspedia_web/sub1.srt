Ok, the reason why they had to spend some money
and again 7% of the big problem, the reason

535
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:31,853
Spend some money and again 7% of the big
problem, the reason they had to was because the

Of the big problem, the reason they had to

They had to was because the last
guy drove the economy into a ditch.

Last guy drove the economy into a
ditch. I'm going to get to my nex

I'm going to get to my nex point.
This is problem which is the

541
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,996
Point. This is problem which is
the democrats get blamed by the

542
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,365
This is problem which is the democrats get
blamed by the vast majority of americans for

543
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,334
Democrats get blamed by the vast majority
of americans for an ineffectual stimulus bill

544
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:53,374
Vast majority of americans for an ineffectual
stimulus bill and almost half of it was

545
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,675
An ineffectual stimulus bill and almost
half of it was republican tax cuts.

546
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,878
And almost half of it was
republican tax cuts. It wn't g eugh.

547
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,180
Republican tax cuts. It wn't
g eugh. It s 1/3 of tax cuts.

548
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,649
It wn't g eugh. It s 1/3 of tax
cuts. Bill: but in a $15 trillion

549
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,951
It s 1/3 of tax cuts. Bill: but in a $15
trillion economy or whatever it is, it

550
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,853
Bill: but in a $15 trillion economy or whatever
it is, it was not nearly enough to do the

551
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:06,454
Economy or whatever it is, it was
not nearly enough to do the job.

552
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,657
Was not nearly enough to do the
job. This is my problem with the

553
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:09,957
Job. This is my problem
with the democrats.

554
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,192
This is my problem with the
democrats. They sign on to shit that

555
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,460
Democrats. They sign on to
shit that wasn't their idea.

556
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,562
They sign on to shit that wasn't
their idea. I no longer understand this

557
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:14,762
Wasn't their idea. I no
longer understand this man.

558
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,496
I no longer understand
this man. And i liked him.

559
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,998
Man. And i liked him.
And i voted for him.

And i liked him. And i voted for
him. I just don't understand this

561
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,467
And i voted for him. I just
don't understand this man anymore.

562
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,669
I just don't understand this man
anymore. When he caved on revenues, i

563
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,170
Man anymore. When he caved on
revenues, i thought this was the line in

564
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,071
When he caved on revenues, i thought
this was the line in the sand.

565
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:25,439
Thought this was the line in the
sand. I thought he would understand,

566
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,309
The sand. I thought he would
understand, that you know, what my

I thought he would understand, that you
know, what my reputation is not good as a

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,445
That you know, what my reputation
is not good as a negotiator.

569
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,481
Reputation is not good as a
negotiator. We need some revenues to fix

Negotiator. We need some
revenues to fix this.

571
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,116
We need some revenues to fix this. When he caved on that
- I

572
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,083
This. When he caved on that
- I mean, they own him.

573
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,052
When he caved on that
- I mean, they own him. >> It's worse than that, bill.

574

Mean, they own him. >> It's worse than
that, bill. I agree with you, he never

you, he never should have done the december

576
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:43,157
I agree with you, he never should have done
the december deal to extend the bush tax

577
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,058
Should have done the december
deal to extend the bush tax cuts.

578
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,360
Deal to extend the bush tax
cuts. That's what's creating the

579
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:47,061
Cuts. That's what's
creating the deficit.

580

That's what's creating
the deficit. One second.

The democrats have yet to put a

598
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:15,256
This. The democrats have yet to
put a plan on the table to deal with

599
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:18,326
The democrats have yet to put a plan on the
table to deal with the debt or the debt ceiling.

600
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,795
Plan on the table to deal with the debt or

The debt or the debt ceiling. Those are
talking points. What happened to transparency?

Those are talking points. What happened
to transparency? What happenedo the idea -

What happenedo the idea

Bill: matt, wasn't the grand bargain, i
don't think he should have linked the debt

Bargain, i don't think he should have
linked the debt ceiling fight with the budget

607
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,373
Should have linked the debt ceiling
fight with the budget fight to begin with.

608
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,175
Ceiling fight with the budget fight to
begin with. The debt ceiling fight is about

609
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:36,777
Fight to begin with. The debt ceiling
fight is about the past, money we've already

The past, money we've already
spent. The budget fight is about the

612
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:38,546
Spent. The budget fight
is about the future.

613

Future. Ok. But he did.

615
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,382
Ok. But he did. Did he
not put on the table a

616
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,484
But he did. Did he not put on the

617
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:44,485
Did he not put on the table a grand bargain
with more deficit reduction than even the

618
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:44,885
Grand bargain with more deficit
reduction than even the republicans?

it to the press. >> It was never in writing.

622
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:55,129
Writing was his budget in

623
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:56,931
Writing was his budget in
january which was sent to the

624

Writing was his budget in january
which was sent to the senate.

625
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,766
January which was sent to the
senate. And he couldn't get any

626

Then he gave a speech which the

97-0. Then he gave a speech
which the c. V.O.An't score.

630
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,308
Then he gave a speech which the c.
V.O.An't score. >> There have bee nber of

You have bole simpson. Bole
simpson has been the pardon -

republicans in the house refuse.

638
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:27,461
Because the republicans in the house
refuse. Then you have the gang of six

639
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,929
House refuse. Then you have the gang
of six which was a bipartisan effort.

640
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,364
Then you have the gang of six which was a
bipartisan effort. >> Wasn't barack obama behind

We have offered as democrats 3-1 a ratio
of cuts to revenue. That was beyond -

So why obama said, you know what, i'm
half in on this shitty idea of yours.

670
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,854
What, i'm half in on this shitty idea
of yours. Instead of saying months ago,

671
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:28,155
Shitty idea of yours. Instead of saying
months ago, this is how democrats would

Instead of saying months ago, this
is how democrats would approach this.

This is how democrats would
approach this. Yes, we are in debt.

674
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,325
Approach this. Yes, we are in
debt. But we've been in debt before.

Yes, we are in debt. But we've been in
debt before. And we've been in debt worse.

676
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,762
But we've been in debt before. And we've been
in debt worse. We need to get people working

get people working so that more taxpayers are

We need to get people working so that
more taxpayers are getting us out of debt.

679
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:45,673
So that more taxpayers are getting us out
of debt. That's an alternative approach.

Getting us out of debt. That's an alternative
approach. >> Paul crudeman's article was

It must be worse than having a
baby they say no man can understand

From it. Yes, i guess kids would
get into trouble because you know

Into trouble because you know when you're
super tired then the stupid ones would say, you

More meth. I just masturbated more
hours because you couldn't sleep and

I just masturbated more hours because you
couldn't sleep and you really couldn't do

985

00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,952
Sideburns, they're kind of
cool. >> What did i just say?

1067
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:54,220
Cool. >> What did i just say?
I said they were saw some.

1068
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,623
>> What did i just say? I said they were
saw some. >> We can be compassionate but

1069
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,158
I said they were saw some. >> We can be compassionate but the question is
- Who pays?

1070
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,393
>> We can be compassionate but the question is
- Who pays? Does government pay?

1071
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:02,462
The question is
- Who pays? Does government pay? And when he led these efforts

1072
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:04,898
Does government pay? And when he led
these efforts it was 22/3 paid by private

1073
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,233
And when he led these efforts it was 22/3 paid by private money
- 2/3 paid by private

1074
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:07,801
It was 22/3 paid by private money
- 2/3 paid by private money.

1075
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:09,803
Money
- 2/3 paid by private money. That's what missing, we can

1076
00:38:09,805 --> 00:38:11,538
Money. That's what missing, we
can have compassion but libalism

1077
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,806
That's what missing, we can have compassion
but libalism is that government has to

1078
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:13,707
Have compassion but libalism is that
government has to provide the dough.

1079
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,375
Is that government has to provide the
dough. Government has to pay for it

1080
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:15,742
Provide the dough. Government
has to pay for it all.

1081
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:16,743
Government has to pay for
it all. There's a balance.

1082
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,778
All. There's a balance. We
can be compassionate but we

1083
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,547
There's a balance. We can be compassionate
but we can be compassionate, it's upon

1084
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,916
We can be compassionate but we can be
compassionate, it's upon us to be compassionate.

1085
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,317
Can be compassionate, it's upon us to be
compassionate. And the government doesn't

1086
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:29,356
Us to be compassionate. And the government
doesn't always have to flip the bill.

1087
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,424
And the government doesn't always have
to flip the bill. >> I cut budgets.

1088
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:33,226
Always have to flip the bill. >> I cut
budgets. But what bill is saying is so

1089
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,060
>> I cut budgets. But what
bill is saying is so critical.

1090
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,362
But what bill is saying is so
critical. There was no vision.

1091
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:36,730
Critical. There was no vision.
We could not put a man on the

1092
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,464
There was no vision. We could not
put a man on the moon right now.

1093
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:39,265
We could not put a man on the moon
right now. We can not get our energy

1094
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:39,833
Moon right now. We can not
get our energy policy past.

1095
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:41,701
We can not get our energy policy
past. We cannot educate our kids.

1096
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,770
Policy past. We cannot educate our
kids. We cannot build infrastructure.

1097
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:46,239
We cannot educate our kids. We cannot build
infrastructure. We are now becoming a country

1098
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,408
We cannot build infrastructure. We are now
becoming a country that is falling behind because

1099
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,444
We are now becoming a country that is falling
behind because the only emphasis is cut taxes.

1100
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:52,479
That is falling behind because the
only emphasis is cut taxes. >> Come on.

1101
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:57,250
The only emphasis is cut
taxes. >> Come on. >> It is.

1102
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,885
>> Come on. >> It is. >> That's absurd!

1103
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,754
>> It is. >> That's absurd!
>> Listen to the debate.

1104
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,622
>> That's absurd! >> Listen to the
debate. Bill: not just cut taxes but

There's nothing hotter than a conservative

Thought we can reach based o a flatter
tax code with lower rates an a broaderase.

1129
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,780
Flatter tax code with lower rates an a
broaderase. This would produce more taxes.

1130
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,650
Rates an a broaderase. This would
produce more taxes. This is the old voodoo

1131
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,151
This would produce more taxes. This is the
old voodoo economics, the old we cut and

1132
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,153
This is the old voodoo economics, the
old we cut and it grows otherwise known as

Maceans that is so discredited. And i think
- What we're

1136
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,128
That is so discredited. And i think
- What we're trying to say is that this idea

1137
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,065
And i think
- What we're trying to say is that this idea in the republican will not go

1138

Trying to say is that this idea
in the republican will not go away.

1139
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,433
In the republican will not go
away. That somehow the american

Away. That somehow the american
economy is a chained beast.

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,571
That somehow the american economy is a
chained beast. If we only let off the chains

1142
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:25,805
Economy is a chained beast. If we only
let off the chains we let off the chains.

If we only let off the chains we let off

With a stick hoping it will blurp
out a lite and it's just not going to

00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,446
Let me finish. Back in december, the
argument for extending the bush tax cuts

1199
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,149
Back in december, the argument for extending
the bush tax cuts was extend it, you will release

1200
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,718
For extending the bush tax cuts was extend it,
you will release this huge $2 trillion pile of

1201
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:18,952
Was extend it, you will release
this huge $2 trillion pile of cash.

1202
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:19,919
This huge $2 trillion pile
of cash. It hasn't happened.

1203
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,155
Cash. It hasn't happened.

Bill: i have one more issue

1206
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,125
Bill: i have one more issue
that's not economics.

1207
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,861
Bill: i have one more issue that's not
economics. I have to get to this because

1208
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:30,196
That's not economics. I have to get to
this because violent religious extremists

1209
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,365
I have to get to this because violent religious
extremists were in the news this week, one

1210
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,700
Violent religious extremists were in
the news this week, one from each side.

1211
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:36,402
Were in the news this week, one from
each side. There's a guy we found out a

From each side. There's a guy we
found out a muslim soldier, a muslim

1213
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,442
There's a guy we found out a muslim

1214
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:45,245
Muslim soldier, a muslim american was
planning up of blowing forthood the same place

1215
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:53,920
American was planning up of blowing forthood the same place that major hasan
- And then we

in his terrorist attack.

1219
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,229
Succeeded in his terrorist
attack. They refuse to call anders

1220
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:04,497
Attack. They refuse to call anders
breivik a christian terrorist

1221
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,832
They refuse to call anders breivik a
christian terrorist but that's what he was.

1222
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,134
Breivik a christian terrorist but that's
what he was. He's a christian terrorist.

1223
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:10,470
But that's what he was. He's a christian
terrorist. He wanted to start a christian

1224
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:14,741
He's a christian terrorist. He wanted to
start a christian onslaught against the muslims

1225
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:16,576
He wanted to start a christian onslaught against the muslims and it reminds me that
- This

1226
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:18,211
Onslaught against the muslims and it reminds me that

And it reminds me that
- This is not a problem with the muslim religion.

1228
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:21,681
Is not a problem with the muslim
religion. It's a problem with religion.

1229
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,784
Muslim religion. It's a problem with
religion. And christianity is perfectly

1230
00:43:24,786 --> 00:43:27,053
It's a problem with religion. And christianity
is perfectly capable of coming out of its

1231
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:29,355
And christianity is perfectly capable of
coming out of its dormant phase and once again

1232
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,391
Capable of coming out of its dormant phase
and once again becoming the blood-Lusty

1233
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:33,993
Dormant phase and once again becoming the
blood-Lusty religion under the crusades.

1234

Becoming the blood-Lusty religion under
the crusades. Bill o'reilly and they're in

as much denial as the muslims.

muslims. He said no one believing in

1238
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,935
Muslims. He said no one believing
in jesus commits mass murder.

1239

He said no one believing in jesus commits
mass murder. Pin head, wt do you think t

Christian extremism. You're
blaming it on the religion.

1268
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,494
You're blaming it on the

00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:41,828
Religion. The bloodiest
murder is atheism.

The same side. It's
fanaticism. It is not religion.

It's fanaticism. It is not religion.
Fanaticism in any ideolog and

what gives people license to commit crazycts

1291
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,115
Religion is what gives people

Atheist country. It's not.
The deer leader is the god.

1307
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:00,106
The deer leader is the god. They think
that when he was born, winter turned into

1308

Crazy a platform. >> No, but it
is the lack of tolerance, bill.
