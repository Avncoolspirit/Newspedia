<i>and older at average risk.</i>      

570
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,397
  I've heard a lot of excuses   

571
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,399
to avoid screening for          
colon cancer.                   

572
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:03,135
        I'm not worried.        
  It doesn't run in my family.  

573
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:06,004
     I can do it next year.     
            No rush.            

574
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,006
Cologuard is the noninvasive    
option                          

575
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,409
that finds 92% of colon cancers.

576
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:12,744
You just get the kit in the     
mail, go to the bathroom,       

577
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:15,080
collect your sample, then ship  
it to the lab.                  

578
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,816
There's no excuse for waiting.  
Get screened.                   

579
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,885
<i>Ask your doctor if Cologuard is</i> 
<i>right for you.</i>

I'm your 70lb St. Bernard puppy,

and my lack of impulse control, 

583
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:30,162
is about to become your problem.

584
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:31,196
        Ahh no, come on.        

585
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,065
 I saw you eating poop earlier.

587
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:37,936
    My focus is on the road,    

588
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,771
 and that's saving me cash with 
           Drivewise.

591
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,775
                        Whoof!  

592
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,579
   So get Allstate where good   
        drivers save 40%        

593
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,915
 for avoiding mayhem, like me.  

594
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,350
             Sorry!

1254
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:52,611
              Available at...   

1255
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:57,248
   My body is truly powerful.   

1256
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,583
I have the power to lower       

1257
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:00,986
my blood sugar and A1C.         

1258
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:01,853
      Because I can still       

1259
00:57:01,856 --> 00:57:02,988
      make my own insulin.      

1260
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,256
    And Trulicity activates     

1261
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:05,257
     my body to release it      

1262
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,392
     like it's supposed to.     

1263
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:09,995
    Trulicity is for people     
    with type 2 diabetes.       

1264
00:57:09,997 --> 00:57:11,263
       It's not insulin.        

1265
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:12,798
     I take it once a week.     

1266
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,866
   It starts acting in my       
   body from the first dose.    

1267
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:17,669
   Trulicity isn't for people   
   with type 1 diabetes         

1268
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:19,404
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

1269
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:21,740
   Don't take Trulicity         
   if you're allergic to it,    

1270
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,143
   you or your family have      
   medullary thyroid cancer,    

1271
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:27,212
   or have multiple endocrine   
   neoplasia syndrome type 2.   

1272
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:29,347
    Stop Trulicity and call     
    your doctor right away      

1273
00:57:29,483 --> 00:57:30,882
       if you have an           
       allergic reaction,       

1274
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:32,284
a lump or swelling in your neck,

1275
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,419
    or severe stomach pain.     

1276
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:36,021
   Serious side effects         
   may include pancreatitis.    

1277
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:39,024
    Taking Trulicity with a     
    sulfonylurea or insulin     

1278
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:40,625
increases low blood sugar risk. 

1279
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:43,829
Side effects include nausea,    
diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, 

1280
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,364
    and decreased appetite,     

1281
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:48,500
 which lead to dehydration and  
 may worsen kidney problems.    

1282
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:51,369
I have it within me             
to lower my A1C.                

1283
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:53,405
Ask your doctor about Trulicity.
