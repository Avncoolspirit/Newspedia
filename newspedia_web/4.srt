      make my own insulin.      

1340
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:52,571
    And Trulicity activates

     my body to release it

     like it's supposed to.     

1343
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,176
    Trulicity is for people     
    with type 2 diabetes.       

1344
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,578
       It's not insulin.        

1345
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,979
     I take it once a week.     

1346
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:03,048
   It starts acting in my       
   body from the first dose.    

1347
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:05,784
   Trulicity isn't for people   
   with type 1 diabetes         

1348
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:07,585
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

1349
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:09,921
   Don't take Trulicity         
   if you're allergic to it,    

1350
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,458
   you or your family have      
   medullary thyroid cancer,    

1351
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,393
   or have multiple endocrine   
   neoplasia syndrome type 2.   

1352
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:17,529
    Stop Trulicity and call     
    your doctor right away      

1353
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,064
       if you have an           
       allergic reaction,       

1354
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,465
a lump or swelling in your neck,

1355
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:21,733
    or severe stomach pain.     

1356
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:24,336
   Serious side effects         
   may include pancreatitis.    

1357
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:27,205
    Taking Trulicity with a     
    sulfonylurea or insulin     

1358
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,807
increases low blood sugar risk. 

1359
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:32,144
Side effects include nausea,    
diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, 

1360
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,545
    and decreased appetite,     

1361
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:36,681
 which lead to dehydration and  
 may worsen kidney problems.    

1362
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:39,618
I have it within me             
to lower my A1C.                

1363
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,620
Ask your doctor about Trulicity.
