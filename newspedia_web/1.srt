 TOM STEYER: Wall Street Banks  
         took advantage         

747
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,731
of millions of Americans during 
         the recession.         

748
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,067
   So, my wife Kat and I took   
            action.             

749
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,535
    We started a non-profit     
         community bank         

750
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:11,837
     with a simple theory -     

751
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,474
give people a fair deal and real
        economic power.         

752
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,875
    Invest in the community,    

753
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,545
in businesses owned by women and
        people of color,        

754
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:20,979
     in affordable housing.     

755
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,415
The difference between words    
and actions matters.            

756
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:25,984
That's a lesson politicians

THERE IS ONLY ONE SET OF FACTS. 
YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT        

1188
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,965
YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT        
OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FACTS   

1189
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:54,266
OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FACTS   
MEAN.                           

1190
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,333
MEAN.                           
BUT ONLY ONE SET.               

1191
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,669
BUT ONLY ONE SET.               
AND NOW I SEE AS THE EQUIVALENT 

1192
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,038
AND NOW I SEE AS THE EQUIVALENT 
OF SORT OF PEPPER SPRAY BEING   

1193
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,273
OF SORT OF PEPPER SPRAY BEING   
USED TO BLIND THE EYES OF THE   

1194
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,108
USED TO BLIND THE EYES OF THE   
PEOPLE FROM SEEING WHAT THE     

1195
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,476
PEOPLE FROM SEEING WHAT THE     
FACTS ARE.                      

1196
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,810
FACTS ARE.                      
I SAW NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED     

1197
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:07,012
I SAW NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED     
DURING ANY OF THE COMMITTEE     

1198
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:08,413
DURING ANY OF THE COMMITTEE     
HEARINGS AND I BELIEVE THAT IS  

1199
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:11,016
HEARINGS AND I BELIEVE THAT IS  
THE CASE WITH THE SENATE        

1200
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,018
THE CASE WITH THE SENATE        
INVESTIGATION AS WELL THAT      

1201
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,087
INVESTIGATION AS WELL THAT      
INDICATED THAT UKRAINE HAD ANY  

1202
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,755
INDICATED THAT UKRAINE HAD ANY  
ORGANIZED ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE. 

1203
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,857
ORGANIZED ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE. 
WHAT I DO REMEMBER IS PRESIDENT 

1204
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,626
WHAT I DO REMEMBER IS PRESIDENT 
CLINTON WHEN HE WAS CANDIDATE --

1205
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:23,028
CLINTON WHEN HE WAS CANDIDATE --
TRUMP, RATHER, WHEN HE SAID     

1206
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,764
TRUMP, RATHER, WHEN HE SAID     
RUSSIA, ARE YOU LISTENING?      

1207
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,132
RUSSIA, ARE YOU LISTENING?      
RUSSIA, ARE YOU LISTENING?      

1208
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:28,099
RUSSIA, ARE YOU LISTENING?      
THEY WERE LISTENING.            

1209
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:30,435
THEY WERE LISTENING.            
FOUR HOURS AFTER HE MADE THAT   

1210
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:35,574
FOUR HOURS AFTER HE MADE THAT   
SPEECH, THE GRU GOT INVOLVED IN 

1211
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:36,841
SPEECH, THE GRU GOT INVOLVED IN 
ATTACKING THE DEMOCRATIC        

1212
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:37,976
ATTACKING THE DEMOCRATIC        
HEADQUARTERS AND THEIR CAMPAIGN.

1213
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,244
HEADQUARTERS AND THEIR CAMPAIGN.
NOW WITH THE QUESTION OF        

1214
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,779
NOW WITH THE QUESTION OF        
UKRAINE, YOU BETTER BE LISTENING

1215
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:42,047
UKRAINE, YOU BETTER BE LISTENING
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT TOOK   

1216
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:42,881
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT TOOK   
PLACE HERE.                     

1217
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,082
PLACE HERE.                     
QUID PRO QUO PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF

1218
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,517
QUID PRO QUO PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF
HEARING IT.                     

1219
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,852
HEARING IT.                     
BUT BASICALLY IT IS SAYING THAT 

1220
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,620
BUT BASICALLY IT IS SAYING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IN ESSENCE WAS    

1221
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,555
THE PRESIDENT IN ESSENCE WAS    
SAYING I HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU

1222
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:50,922
SAYING I HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU
NEED.                           

1223
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:53,325
NEED.                           
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT I WANT. 

1224
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,127
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT I WANT. 
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.              

1225
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:55,994
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.              
YOU GO FIRST.                   

1226
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,762
YOU GO FIRST.                   
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT HAS 

1227
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:58,930
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT HAS 
TAKEN PLACE WITH UKRAINE.       

1228
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:00,465
TAKEN PLACE WITH UKRAINE.       
AND SO THOSE ARE THE FACTS.     

1229
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,335
AND SO THOSE ARE THE FACTS.     
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHERS SAY

1230
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,137
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHERS SAY
THAT THE UKRAINIANS WERE SOMEHOW

1231
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:07,138
THAT THE UKRAINIANS WERE SOMEHOW
INVOLVED OR BIDEN'S SON WAS     

1232
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,407
INVOLVED OR BIDEN'S SON WAS     
SOMEHOW INVOLVED, THE FACTS ARE 

1233
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:11,610
SOMEHOW INVOLVED, THE FACTS ARE 
CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT INVITED

1234
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:13,078
CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT INVITED
ANOTHER COUNTRY TO PARTICIPATE  

1235
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,480
ANOTHER COUNTRY TO PARTICIPATE  
IN OUR ELECTOR SYSTEM.          

1236
00:45:14,482 --> 00:45:16,615
IN OUR ELECTOR SYSTEM.          
THAT TO ME IS AN IMPEACHABLE    

1237
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:16,882
THAT TO ME IS AN IMPEACHABLE    
OFFENSE.                        

1238
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:17,749
OFFENSE.                        
>> AND YOU'RE THE FORMER        

1239
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,951
>> AND YOU'RE THE FORMER        
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.           

1240
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:23,022
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.           
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE    

1241
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,355
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE    
STATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY   

1242
00:45:24,357 --> 00:45:26,158
STATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY   
WHEN THEY CLAIM THERE WAS       

1243
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,759
WHEN THEY CLAIM THERE WAS       
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION    

1244
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:28,493
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION    
WHICH IS A RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY   

1245
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:28,694
WHICH IS A RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY   
THEORY.                         

1246
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:30,195
THEORY.                         
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SENATORS AND 

1247
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:33,031
YOU TALK ABOUT THE SENATORS AND 
CONGRESS PEOPLE IN WATERGATE, I 

1248
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:34,766
CONGRESS PEOPLE IN WATERGATE, I 
IMAGINE THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO   

1249
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:37,669
IMAGINE THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO   
YOU SAID WERE LISTENING TO THE  

1250
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:38,637
YOU SAID WERE LISTENING TO THE  
FACTS, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN      

1251
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,172
FACTS, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN      
FACING PRESSURE IN THEIR HOME   

1252
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:42,241
FACING PRESSURE IN THEIR HOME   
DISTRICTS BY PEOPLE WHO         

1253
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,909
DISTRICTS BY PEOPLE WHO         
SUPPORTED NIXON AND DIDN'T WANT 

1254
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,144
SUPPORTED NIXON AND DIDN'T WANT 
TO SEE NIXON GO DOWN.           

1255
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:49,314
TO SEE NIXON GO DOWN.           
HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO MUSTER THE

1256
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,917
HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO MUSTER THE
COURAGE TO LISTEN TO FACTS WHEN 

1257
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,151
COURAGE TO LISTEN TO FACTS WHEN 
THESE FOLKS DON'T SEEM TO BE?   

1258
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:55,787
THESE FOLKS DON'T SEEM TO BE?   
>> WELL IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD

1259
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:56,054
>> WELL IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD
THEN.                           

1260
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:56,855
THEN.                           
WE DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA.    

1261
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:59,057
WE DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA.    
WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE NETWORK      

1262
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,592
WE DIDN'T HAVE ONE NETWORK      
DEVOTED TO DEFENDING THE        

1263
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:00,859
DEVOTED TO DEFENDING THE        
PRESIDENT.                      

1264
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:02,060
PRESIDENT.                      
SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD.    

1265
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:03,662
SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD.    
BUT NONETHELESS, THEY FELT      

1266
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:06,264
BUT NONETHELESS, THEY FELT      
COMPELLED TO RISE ABOVE THEIR   

1267
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,866
COMPELLED TO RISE ABOVE THEIR   
OWN PARTY INTEREST AND PUT THE  

1268
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:08,267
OWN PARTY INTEREST AND PUT THE  
COUNTRY FIRST.                  

1269
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,534
COUNTRY FIRST.                  
AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS AT   

1270
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:10,402
AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS AT   
STAKE HERE.                     

1271
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,537
STAKE HERE.                     
THIS IS ABOUT, YES, ABOUT TRUMP 

1272
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:13,739
THIS IS ABOUT, YES, ABOUT TRUMP 
AND THE IMPEACHMENT OF TRUMP.   

1273
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:14,740
AND THE IMPEACHMENT OF TRUMP.   
BUT REALLY WHAT IS AT STAKE IS  

1274
00:46:14,742 --> 00:46:16,008
BUT REALLY WHAT IS AT STAKE IS  
THE RULE OF LAW.                

1275
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,942
THE RULE OF LAW.                
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID  

1276
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,810
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID  
THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO HIM.   

1277
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:20,145
THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO HIM.   
THAT HE CAN'T BE CHARGED WITH   

1278
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:20,479
THAT HE CAN'T BE CHARGED WITH   
ANYTHING.                       

1279
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,113
ANYTHING.                       
THAT HE CAN'T EVEN BE           

1280
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:22,414
THAT HE CAN'T EVEN BE           
INVESTIGATED.                   

1281
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,883
INVESTIGATED.                   
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE MAN  

1282
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:25,951
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE MAN  
RULE.                           

1283
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,419
RULE.                           
THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY.          

1284
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:30,155
THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY.          
THAT IS SOMETHING CLOSER TO     

1285
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:33,092
THAT IS SOMETHING CLOSER TO     
AUTOCRACY OR CERTAINLY TO A     

1286
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:33,491
AUTOCRACY OR CERTAINLY TO A     
DICTATORSHIP.                   

1287
00:46:33,493 --> 00:46:34,592
DICTATORSHIP.                   
I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN    

1288
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:36,362
I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN    
PEOPLE ONCE THEY LISTEN TO ALL  

1289
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:38,229
PEOPLE ONCE THEY LISTEN TO ALL  
OF THE FACTS WILL SAY THAT IS A 

1290
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:39,031
OF THE FACTS WILL SAY THAT IS A 
STANDARD WE WANT.               

1291
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:42,434
STANDARD WE WANT.               
NO RULES APPLY TO ANY PRESIDENT 

1292
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:43,035
NO RULES APPLY TO ANY PRESIDENT 
GOING FORWARD.                  

1293
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,302
GOING FORWARD.                  
I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN    

1294
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:45,237
I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN    
PEOPLE SUPPORT THAT.            

1295
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,772
PEOPLE SUPPORT THAT.            
I THINK IT IS INCOUPLE BENT UPON

1296
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:47,572
I THINK IT IS INCOUPLE BENT UPON
THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THE       

1297
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:48,707
THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THE       
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO    

1298
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:52,177
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO    
JOIN IN, INCUMBENT TO MAKE THE  

1299
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,779
JOIN IN, INCUMBENT TO MAKE THE  
CASE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO THROW

1300
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:55,447
CASE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO THROW
AWAY ALL THAT WE HAVE           

1301
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,948
AWAY ALL THAT WE HAVE
